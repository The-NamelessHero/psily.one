    <p>Dear Void,</p>
    <p>I know you're always listening, since She is there I just wanted to let you know that I might have slowed down a lot during life, however I never stopped thinking about the possible outcomes on what could have been. Maybe we need to go back down to two dots and wiggle again.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>One who never gave up.</p>
